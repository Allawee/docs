# Get your test token

You can get your test token by generating one while your dashboard is in the test mode. The top right of your screen reflects this. If you are in live mode, you can toggle the button to get into the test mode. You can then generate a new API key, assigning the permissions as you wish. You should copy the test key upon creation, as you can only view it once.

N.B. A test key starts with `sk.test.`.
